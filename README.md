# Critical Mass Lunch and Learn (10-20-23)

## Quick Mobile Tech Stack

**Description:** 
Deliver your deliverables from a place considered for most to be considered a place where you cannot deliver (in the key of android).

**HARDWARE:**
1. Android phone - *Required*
- You are going to need to set security to be able to ["side load"](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-apks-31494/) 3rd party apps.
2. Bluetooth keyboard - *Optional*
- I hate using the phone keyboard. Most all keyboard shortcuts translate over and it makes it SUPER fun to navigate a phone. I like using this one right [here](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2A3LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english).
3. A tripod for your phone - *Optional*
- After a few months of having it sitting flat I knew I needed to have something like [this](https://pocket-tripod.com/). It just looks cool, that is it.


**SOFTWARE**
1. [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/)
 - A 3rd party app store. You will use it to download and install the terminal and IDE listed below.

2. [TMUX](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
- Termux is a terminal emulator with Linux package collection. This opens up the CLI for all sorts of good stuff. This is my favorite there are many like it, but this is one is my favorite.

3. [Acode](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.foxdebug.acode/)
- An IDE for working from the phone. It is shaped after VSCode so it feels familiar. There are many that do the job, but this works for my style.
